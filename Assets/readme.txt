Cool features:
- lootable station
- imposter can turn in to monster model if he wants to move fast/kill? [Done-ish]

Plot:
empty space station, super expensive items on it and abandoned
- tales of a monster on it, everyone whose tried to loot it doesnt return
- were a bad ass group of thieves
- repair station shit, loot items
- survive for 5 mins? loot to certain amount of $$? survivors get profit?

Ideas:

- Mobile/handlight that you can carry or place around

- Writing task with keyboard?

- one part in HL2 requires you to find multiple car batteries and insert them to progress
have a resource spread around randomly around, and the players have to find and bring them back to a point
(3 batterys to activate a powersource for example)

- locked doors [DONE-ish]

- trap lever at cameras, to trigger floor death/crushing player or something

- trip mines to activate and pin to a wall/something

- furnace to burn/hide bodies

- trash chute to hide/get rid of bodies

- giant hole in the floor to hide/get rid of bodies

- blood trails

- enter in keypad info

- red light to indicate broken task, green light to indicate task is done?

- fix air filtration system/hvac

- wiring task (maybe wire trip mines?)

- body scanner

- water plants in hydrophonic farm

- bring wood to furnace (can freeze to death)

- debug the retro encabulator

- reboot security cameras

- conveyer belt where you have to sort items

- soil mineral testing

- chemical mixing where if you fuck up you can cause an explosion

- water filtration, drag over the filter to replace it?

- gas activation, which creates a fog in the scene to make it harder to see people in the tunnels?

- drag solar panels to sunlight

- fuse boxes, have to find emissive fuses in the dark and stuff to power each room?

- gather parts to make an imposter scanner as objective?


- Force players to work together to build up a physics ladder of sorts to reach a task??
